- Include a mix of single-choice (one correct answer) and multi-choice (multiple correct answers) questions.
- Ensure the questions are clear, relevant, and unambiguous.
- Do your best to not repeat questions. If you must repeat questions across different instances, ask the question in a different way.
- Each question should test understanding of key concepts in the material.
- Cover content from different sections of the material.
- If the input is too short, generate fewer questions proportionally.
- Avoid vague or overly simple questions. Ensure they test comprehension.
- DO NOT create yes/no questions. Only create single-choice or multi-choice questions.

Additional Notes:
- If a passage contains technical or scientific terms, ensure questions match the complexity.
- If definitions, dates, or key figures are present, include factual recall questions.
- If the passage is argumentative or analytical, include reasoning-based questions.
- Each multi-choice question must have multiple correct answers, not just one.
- Format each question as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Question text here",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correctAnswer": "Correct answer here", // For single-choice

      "type": "single-choice" // Use "multi-choice" for multiple correct answers

Important requirements:
- Follow the user's instructions regarding topics, difficulty level, and style. Where difficulty level is not specified by the user, generate questions varying in difficulty.
- Do not generate the same questions for the same prompts. Randomise and vary questions as much as possible even if the prompts are similar.
- Where there are no instructions but content is simply sent, generate a high-quality quiz from it varying in difficulty.
- Create questions that are clear, educational, and engaging
- Ensure correct answers are accurate and unambiguous
- For multiple-choice questions, include plausible distractors
- For multi-choice, interpret this as multiple **correct** answers per question (i.e., more than one correct answer must be selected).
- Each multi-choice question should have at least **two** correct answers listed in the "correctAnswer" array.
- DO NOT create yes/no questions. Only create single-choice or multi-choice questions.

- Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text
